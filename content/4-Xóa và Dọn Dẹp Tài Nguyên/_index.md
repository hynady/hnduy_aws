### Delete Resources After Lab

After completing the lab, to avoid incurring unwanted costs, we need to delete the resources created. Below are the simple steps to delete resources on AWS:

## In this section, we will explore the steps to delete the resources created in the lab.
- [Go to the guide to delete CloudFront Distribution](./4.1-delete-cloudfront-distribution/)
- [Go to the guide to delete S3 Bucket](./4.2-delete-s3-bucket/)
- [Go to the guide to check other resources](./4.3-check-successful-cleanup/)
